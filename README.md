I DID NOT MAKE THIS!!!

Demo: https://adamtrex.azurewebsites.net/Games/Classic_PC/98/programs/MS-DOS/ID-Games/quake_2/quake2.exe.html

All credit goes to the original source port creators: https://github.com/stefanhaustein/quake2-playn-port

I just made this work

So here is the first thing you need to do is to get the Playn Quake 2 Demo repo from here: https://github.com/MagnusMarx/Quake2-PlayN-MagnusPort/archive/refs/heads/master.zip

Next you will need to download the demo exe file from here: https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/quake2demo/q2-314-demo-x86.exe

Upload the .exe file and source port to your website because this is the only way for this to work.

Then, where the game shows this link: http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/quake2demo/q2-314-demo-x86.exe

replace it with the location on the website where you stored the .exe file

so instead, it would say something like: https://[your website here]/quake2demo.exe

If you have anymore questions, don't hesitate to contact me and my team at magnusteam.contact@gmail.com

Thx!

Demo: http://quake2playn.appspot.com/ 

- If you visit the demo with `https:`, you'll need to change the download link in the input field from `http:` to `https:`, too, as pointed out in issue #1. Ill fix this when I get a chance.
